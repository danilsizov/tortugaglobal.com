A one stop plugin for all your fonts, FontMeister pulls fonts from Google Web Fonts, Typekit, Fontdeck and Font Squirrel for you to use in any theme.

== Description ==

FontMeister lets you preview, add and use fonts from the most common sources of fonts on the web. The plugin supports fonts from:

*   <a href='http://www.google.com/webfonts'>Google Web Fonts</a>
*   <a href='http://typekit.com'>Typekit</a>
*   <a href='http://fontdeck.com'>Fontdeck</a>
*   <a href='http://fontsquirrel.com'>Font Squirrel</a>

Using FontMeister is easy. Enter your details for the individual providers in the "Font Sources" section of the plugin. Then go to the "Fonts"
section, and pick the fonts you want to use. You can add your own selectors to the fonts, and the plugin will include them on your site.

= More Sources =

Work is underway to support the following:

*	<a href='http://fonts.com/'>Fonts.com</a>
*	Manually uploaded @font-face kits

= Bonus Features =

FontMeister has been written keeping themes in mind. Currently fonts selected in FontMeister are added automatically to font
selection drop-downs in the Suffusion theme. If you are a theme author and you wish to have the capability to do the same for
your theme, contact the plugin author for instructions.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it,
or by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped
contents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1.	A menu is created for FontMeister with 2 pages - one for setting up your sources and the other for picking the fonts.
2.	Enter the details for the sources you want to pull fonts from.
3.	See the list of fonts available from each source in the Fonts section.
4.  Preview individual fonts. Vary the weights and the base font size to pick the right mix for your site.
5.  Fine tune your selections by picking a smaller set of variants or subsets, and assign selectors to each font.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about other font providers? =

Support is planned for Fonts.com and other providers. If you have specific suggestions do post them.

= Can the fonts defined in FontMeister be added to the font list in my theme? =

FontMeister provides a function <code>add_more_fonts</code> that can be used by the theme authors to augment their
list. Alternatively they can define their own hook and provide it to me and I can add the support natively in the plugin.

= Are there any known issues? =

Yes, unfortunately there are a handful.

*	For Font Squirrel, in some cases while downloading a font from the resultant zip file is empty (0KB). In most cases this
happens for larger zip archives. The issue resolves itself if a download is reattempted after an interval of time. Alternatively you can manually
download the zip file and unzip the contents to the "fontmeister" directory in your "uploads" folder.
*	Another known issue for Font Squirrel occurs when <strong>your site uses SSL</strong> and you attempt to preview / download a font. Font Squirrel's API
<strong>doesn't support SSL</strong>, so you will not be able to preview / download the font. I am not currently aware of a way to fix this issue. In a
future iteration I will support the manual upload of font kits, which will get past this issue.
*	For Fontdeck sometimes the generated CSS file generated by Fontdeck doesn't contain all the added fonts. This seems to be a
bug with Fontdeck itself, and might need you to get in touch with them to sort the CSS out.
