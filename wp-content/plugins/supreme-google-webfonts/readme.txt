Description: Adds all Google Webfonts into your visual editor panel when creating posts or pages.  Now you have access to almost 700 universal, cross-browser compatible fonts.

== Description ==

This plugin simply activates, and makes accessible the ENTIRE Google Webfonts repository.  Your visual editor will show a new, third row with an easy drop-down list for choosing fonts.

I also added a box for font size selection... they seem to go hand in hand.
